Vocal Mehrunes' Razor v1.0 by arunsundibob


---------------------------
Description
---------------------------
It appears that Mehrunes Dagon likes to play with dice, and as any gambling daedra lord would, he can get a bit excitable.
Vocal Mehrunes' Razor (VMR) allows Dagon to share this excitement with his champion by commenting on the kills you perform
with his Razor. As the killing of mortals is not exactly something new to him, he'll usually just chuckle a little, but
catch him in the right mood and you'll find him somewhat more expressive...

---------------------------
Purpose and Functionality
---------------------------
VMR allows for the player to know when a kill was made due to to the Razor's enchantment without being as immersion 
breaking as a message at the top of the screen. It also brings some life into the weapon itself.

The appearance and functionality of Mehrunes' Razor is exactly the same as it was in the vanilla version.
This means that the 1.98% chance of killing a target has not changed. This mod only adds the sounds that will occur
when a target is killed by Mehrunes' Razor's enchantment.

There are 9 possible lines for Dagon to say and their probability of being said are

80% for the laugh
2.5% each for the other 8  (total 20%)

This should make Dagon's remarks seem less repetitive and as intrusive.

---------------------------
Installation
---------------------------
The mod is BAIN-ready for those who use Wrye-Smash, but if you prefer to install it manually, simply copy everyting into
your Skyrim data folder.

Feedback
---------------------------
As my first mod, this was more of an exercise to become familiar with Papyrus before I make another mod that I've been
conceptualizing but I still intend to tweak with this one to get the sounds/probabilities just right. Please post on the nexus
page to let me know what works and how i could improve things.
